            A weekly club I founded where I provided support and a sense of
            belonging for both international and indigenous students. Through
            this club, we organized monthly school trips and activities to
            foster inclusivity and cultural diversity. Additionally, I advocated
            for administrative initiatives such as international culture
            celebrations and displaying flags in the hallways to promote
            diversity awareness.
